# StepandHeightcounter
This app counts steps and elevation gain on a Nexus 5x (and maybe other devices with an step sensor and a pressure sensor).
Elevation gain is counted only when walking, so driving and elevators will not count.

You should shut off measurement when walking in subways or trains, as measurement of elevation gain would be disturbed.
